# AI Image Organizer (Stable Diffusion)

### This script is simply for organizing all of your generated images that are usually located in your output directory

---

#### Why did I create this script

<p>
It's nice when all of you images are in the same place, but if you're anything like me who uses more than one checkpoint and you have no idea which one is which, then organization is key.  It's possible to organize all this yourself with the PNG Info tab within Stable Diffusion, but if you have to go through hundreds of images this'll take a long time.  This is why I've written a script to help automate this process.

#### What it does

<p>
When you run the script/executable file, a GUI window will appear with two input fields, the source directory and the destination directory.  When you select the source directory (usually the folder with all the png files) and the destination directory (the folder you want those images to navigate to), all you have to do is press the Process button, and the script will copy all the image from the source directory and place them into their respective folders within the chosen destination.

#### How to run it

<p>
If you have familiarity with Python, you run your virtual environment, install your packages from the requirements.txt file, and simply run the script.  With Windows or Linux (doesn't work with WSL2 unless you have a graphics library installed, haven't tested with Mac) a GUI interface should appear

If you have no experience with Python or aren't a developer, not to worry!  I got you covered.
