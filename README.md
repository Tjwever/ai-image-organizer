# AI Image Organizer (Stable Diffusion)

### A script to effortlessly organize your generated images within the output directory 📸

---

#### Why did I create this script? 🤔

It's great when all your images are in one place, but if you're like me, using multiple checkpoints can get confusing. Enter organization! While you can manually organize with the PNG Info tab within Stable Diffusion, it's a tedious task for hundreds of images. That's why I've crafted a script to automate this process.

#### How to run it 🛠️

If you're a Python pro, fire up your virtual environment, install packages from requirements.txt, and run the script. For non-developers, don't sweat it!

- Download the repo 📥
- Double-click the art_organizer.exe file 🖱️
- Ensure the _internal directory is in the same location as art_organizer.exe for it to work.

#### How to use it 🚀

After running the script/executable file, and a user-friendly GUI window will pop up with two input fields: source directory and destination directory. Select your source (folder with PNG files) and destination, hit the Process button, and voila! The script will neatly organize the images into their respective folders within the chosen destination.

#### What the future holds 🚀

While the current setup may be a bit complex for non-Python folks, I'm considering switching to cx_freeze for a simpler experience. The goal is to make this app as user-friendly as possible.

- **Future Features** 🚀
  - Simplify setup with a one-click app 🌐
  - Add customization options for users 🎨
    - Grouping by prompt keywords, Sampler, Lora, etc.
